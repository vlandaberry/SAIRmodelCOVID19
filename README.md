# SAIR model COVID-19
In this repository you cand fin the code and equations for the SAIR model to analyze COVID-19 spread in a particular country. We created this model whith [@jmsancho](https://github.com/jmsancho).
It is based on the more traditional epidemiological models (SIR and SEIR) but we add some modifications to adapt the dynamic of the model to some features of COVID-19 spread. 

The documentation is this repository:
- SAIR.pdf is the model, and the equations. 
- SAIR.py is the code in python.
